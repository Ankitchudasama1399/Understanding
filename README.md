1st Problem Explenition :


Code 1 Analysis: Delayed State Update

In React, state updates using useState are asynchronous, meaning they don't immediately reflect the new state value. Instead, React schedules the state update and continues with the rest of the function. This is why you're seeing the older value of count in the console.log.

Solution for Code 1:

To log the updated value, you can use the useEffect hook. The useEffect hook runs after the render is complete, and you can use it to perform side effects, like logging the updated count.



2nd Problem Explention :


Code 2 Analysis: Multiple State Updates

In this code snippet, the issue is related to the synchronous nature of state updates. When you call setCount multiple times in quick succession, React doesn't immediately update the state. Instead, it batches the updates, and the state is only updated once the component re-renders.

Solution for Code 2:

To achieve the expected behavior, you can use the functional form of setCount, which takes the previous state as an argument. This ensures that each state update is based on the latest state.
